# AMIGO SERVER #

### Project Description ðŸ“‘

AMIGO is a social media platform for recommendations, where users can recommend experiences,  products or places to their friends. Much like twitter, people can create recommendations and comment on each other's posts. 

### User Stories ðŸ“‹

* As an AMIGO user I would like to Login to my account to go into the system
* As an AMIGO user I would like to Logout of my account so other people can't access my account
* As an AMIGO user I would like to browse the feed of recommendations
* As an AMIGO user I would like to  click on a specific recommendation to view the comments related to it 
* As an AMIGO user I would like to edit a recommendation I created previously to make sure it doesn't contain any mistakes
* As an AMIGO user I would like to delete a recommendation I created previously
* As an AMIGO user I would like to comment on recommendations to have discussions with others online
* As an AMIGO user I would like to receive comments on my recommendations

* As an AMIGO user I would like to share my recommendations with people on Twitter
* As an AMIGO user I would like to see relevant Tweets from people I follow on Twitter so I don't miss out on anything on both platforms
